## What You Can Do With Python? 

A many tech workshops I get asked a common question of what are the things I can do with python? Well, sense this question gets asked on a recurring basis I decided to do a deep dive into this question. The simple answer is that by being a proficient python developer you can find work at a tech company. But, after further thinking it over I feel like that answer is a tad bit trite. So, I did some more research.

Since there are many online databases that contain jobs for python developers I decided to do extensive research on this subject and create this project on GitHub. This project has three components; two high level portions, and one low level one.

 - [Software engineering careers with python](test). 
 - [Resources for those who want a career.](test)  
 - [Code snippets](test) to illustrate some of the popular libraries,  frameworks, etc, requested by employers.

I believe it’s a solid strategy to understand the common jobs of python developers. Developers work at companies, and companies create products/services to solve a problem. If the company is consistently profitable then perhaps they’re doing a decent job of solving whatever problem is on hand.
 
So, by researching common jobs of a python dev and analyzing companies that they work for we can start creating a more lucid picture of what you can accomplish with python. 

This project is a work in progress. Contributors and constructive criticism is highly encouraged.
